Be sure to turn on the custom background option in settings.

Dumb script that does dumb things to the background. Ignores spoiled posts and anything that isn't webm/mp4/png/jpg/gif. Can keep a list of urls to be used as a background. The listings might not look like it but you can click on them to change the background image to the clicked item.
